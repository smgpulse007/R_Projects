#### Section 1: Probability : Total points 50


Q1. Which of the following numbers cannot be probability? Explain why.     

a) -0.0001
b) 0.05
c) 3.415
d) 20%
e) 1

Ans 1.  

Q2. A card is drawn randomly from a deck of ordinary playing cards. The game rules are that you win if the card is a spade or an ace. What is the probability that you will win the game?

Ans 2. 

Q3. An urban hospital has a 20% mortality rate on average for admitted patients. If on a particular day, 17 patients got admitted, what are:

a) the chances that exactly 7 will survive?

b) the chances that at least 15 patients will survive?    

Ans 3.

Q4. Let F and G be two events such that P(F) is 0.4, P(G) is 0.8. F and G are independent events. Fill in the remaining elements of the table.

Table    | $G$ | $\bar{G}$ | Marginal
---------|-----|-----------|----------
$F$      |     |           | 
$\bar{F}$|     |           |
Marginal |     |           |    1


Q5. Let F and G be two events such that P(F) is 0.2, P(G) is 0.7. Now, the conditional probability P(G|F) is given as 0.4. Fill in the remaining elements of the table.

Table    | $G$ | $\bar{G}$ | Marginal
---------|-----|-----------|----------
$F$      |     |           | 
$\bar{F}$|     |           |
Marginal |     |           |    1


Q6. A survey was conducted among 100 patients about smoking status. The following is the sample size split by smoking status (Yes or No) and gender (Male or Female). 


Table    | Smoking (Yes) | Smoking(No) | Total
---------|---------------|-------------|----------
Male     |               |             | 55
Female   |               |             | 45
Total    |       32      |        68   | 100 


The probability that a randomly selected patient is a male who smokes is 0.19.  

(a) Fill in all the elements of the table


(b) What is the probability of a randomly selected patient being a female?    
 

(c) What is the probability of a randomly selected patient being a smoker?     


(d)  What is the probability of a randomly selected smoker being a female?    


#### Section 2: Data Analysis using R: Total points 25


Q1 : Using the dataset provided ("sample_patient_dataset.csv"), the task to build a 2x2 table for the studying the association between age at admission >70 and cardiac arrests. You can either use the sample table given below or build your own. Rememer to output both count and % in the table. Be sure to round the % to the nearest integer (e.g, 0.674 will be 67% and 0.675 will be 68%, see notes in Lecture2 on summary statistics as example). Fill in the code in the shaded areas.


Table         | Cardiac Arrests (Yes) | Cardiac Arrests (No) | Total
--------------|-----------------------|----------------------|----------
Age > 70 (%)  |                       |                      | 
Age <= 70 (%) |                       |                      | 
Total         |                       |                      | 24,107

Q2: Create your own de-identified version of "patient_dataset.csv". Upload your de-identified dataset onto Canvas and write the de-identification code below. You will need to refer to the document "Deidentification.pdf" (on Canvas, look under files -> lectures -> lecture_2).
