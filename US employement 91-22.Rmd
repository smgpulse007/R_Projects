## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
work <- read_csv("aged_15plus_employment_rate_percent.csv")
work_us <- subset.data.frame(work, country == "United States")

work_ust <- work_us %>% t %>% as.data.frame() 

#work_ust = work_ust[-1,]
tibble::rownames_to_column(df = work_ust)
df <- cbind(rownames(work_ust), work_ust)
colnames(df) <- c("Year", "USA")
df = df[-1,]


ggplot(df, aes(x = Year, y = USA)) + geom_jitter() + theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = "darkblue", 
                      size = 1, linetype = "solid"), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +  geom_point(data=df[23:27,], aes(x=Year, y=USA), colour="red", size=7) + ggtitle("Employement rate of US after the release of Britney Spears' Work Bitch! in 2013")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
